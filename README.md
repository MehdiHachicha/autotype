Simulates keyboard input that types bash commands to write the contents of a folder.
Tested on Windows using Thonny. Best to execute it from an IDE, it would be tricky
to stop the process in a terminal as the keyboard will be constantly typing.

1. Prepare the folder you want to copy.
2. On the target machine, navigate to where you want to put the typed folder.
3. Run this script, give it a name for future typed folder, and the path to the prepared folder.
4. During the count-down, switch back to where you want the keyboard to type. After count-down, the script will start typing. Don't touch anything while the script is running, best keep the typing location windowed. To terminate the script, press 'escape'. In an emergency, switch back to your IDE and stop the process manually.
